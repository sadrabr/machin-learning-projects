# Machine Learning Projects (Academic Portfolio)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning exercises and mini-projects implemented in Python, primarily as **Jupyter Notebooks**. The goal is to strengthen practical understanding of **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** through well-scoped experiments on real-world style datasets.

These notebooks are organized as numbered exercises (e.g., `Exercise 1.ipynb`, `Exercise 2.ipynb`, ...), each focusing on a specific ML task and workflow.

## Highlights

- End-to-end ML workflows: **EDA → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation**
- Supervised learning (classification/regression) with standard baselines
- Model evaluation using metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**
- Clean, reproducible experimentation in notebook form

## Repository Structure

Typical files include:

- `Exercise 1.ipynb`
- `Exercise 2.ipynb`
- `Exercise 3.ipynb`
- `Exercise 4.ipynb` – **Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)**  
  Includes data exploration, feature preprocessing/encoding, training models (e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost depending on the exercise version), and evaluation with common classification metrics.

> Note: The exact set of exercises may evolve as new notebooks are added.
